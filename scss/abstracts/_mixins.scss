Explain what's in the mixin
- We are going to call this respond mixin here,
- We're going to include it,
- and we will parse a breakpoint
- If the breakpoint is phone, then we want something to happen
- And what we want to happen, is the exact media query

Why use this mixin?
This mixins allow us to parse simply the word "phone" in there and then it will figure out which media query it will do 

Why ems in media query?
- Rems fail to work as intended in some of the browsers so we will use ems
- ems are the best option for media queries
- for more info https://zellwk.com/blog/media-query-units/

- 1em = 16px
- ex: 600px / 16px = 37.5em

        // only screen - First condition and then the max width
        // If someone tries to print out our page, then these media queries dont applied. So they only applied to screens.
