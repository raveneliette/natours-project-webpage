----- Media Query Manager -----

0 - 600px:       Phone
600 - 900px:     Tablet portrait
900 - 1200px:    Tablet landscape
[1200 - 1800] is where our normal styles apply
1800px + :       Big desktop

$breakpoint argument choices:
- phone
- tab-port
- tab-land
- big-desktop

Explain what's in the mixin
- We are going to call this respond mixin here,
- We're going to include it,
- and we will parse a breakpoint
- If the breakpoint is phone, then we want something to happen
- And what we want to happen, is the exact media query

Why use this mixin?
This mixins allow us to parse simply the word "phone" in there and then it will figure out which media query it will do 

Why ems in media query?
- Rems fail to work as intended in some of the browsers so we will use ems
- ems are the best option for media queries

- 1em = 16px
- ex: 600px / 16px = 37.5em
